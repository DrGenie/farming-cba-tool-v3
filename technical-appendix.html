      <h1>What the tool does</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        You upload your trial data. The tool averages replicates within each treatment, compares each treatment to the control,
        and reports the economic difference using a consistent set of assumptions.
      </p>

      <h2>The workflow</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the template and enter your data.</li>
        <li>Mark at least one row as the control.</li>
        <li>Upload, then run analysis.</li>
        <li>Read the leaderboard and plots.</li>
        <li>Export a short report if needed.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Minimum data needed</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>At least one control row and at least one treatment row.</li>
        <li>A treatment name (same name for all replicates of that treatment).</li>
        <li>Yield in tonnes per hectare.</li>
        <li>Total cost per hectare.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Worked example</h2>
      <p>
        Suppose a treatment has 4 replicate plots with yields of 7.3, 6.3, 7.6 and 7.7 t/ha.
        The tool averages them to 7.23 t/ha.
      </p>
      <p>
        If grain price is $500/t, annual benefit is 7.23 × 500 = $3,615 per hectare.
        If the annual cost is $885/ha, the net per year is $2,730/ha.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool then discounts future years and sums them to a present value so all treatments are comparable.
      </p>

      <h2>What “discounting” means in practice</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Discounting just means that benefits and costs in later years count a bit less than the same dollar today.
        The tool applies the same rate to all treatments, so rankings are consistent.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding the tabs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Home</strong>: what the tool does and the steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Data</strong>: upload your file, check what was detected, set the control and assumptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Results</strong>: leaderboard and tables. Run analysis here.</li>
        <li><strong>Plots</strong>: charts for quick comparison.</li>
        <li><strong>Export</strong>: download report and cleaned data.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        If something does not look right, check the Data tab first. Most issues are caused by a missing control mark,
        inconsistent treatment names, or numbers entered with commas or symbols.
